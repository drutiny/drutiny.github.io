When you are copying files from your production\nserver back to staging or development, you can quickly fill up your disk\nspace. It's possible to use the files on the production server for your\nstaging site without copying them by using [Stage File Proxy](https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/stage_file_proxy)\nmodule.\n\nUsing the Stage File Proxy module enables a development server to maintain a\nclean files directory and use files from an alternate source by directly\nreferencing that alternate source. An additional option within the module\nallows the file system on the development server to be seeded with files\nfrom the production server.\n","type":"audit","success":"Stage File Proxy module is enabled.","failure":"Stage File Proxy module is not enabled.","remediation":"Install and configure the [Stage File Proxy](https:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/stage_file_proxy)\nmodule into your codebase.\n\nRead more about [Serving files from production on development environments](https:\/\/docs.acquia.com\/article\/serving-files-production-development-environments)\n","severity":2}
