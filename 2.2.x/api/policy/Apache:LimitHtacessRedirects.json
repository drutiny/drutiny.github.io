Redirect rules should be\nrefactored to take advantage of regular expressions if possible. Otherwise the\nredirect module should be added to the site and all of the redirects in the\n`.htaccess` file should be moved into the Drupal site. Although\nthese redirects will then require a Drupal bootstrap in order to fulfill the\nrequest, Varnish will be able to cache the redirect once it has been made once\n as long as there is a maximum age set on the site.\n","type":"audit","tags":["Performance"],"success":".htaccess redirects less than `{{max_redirects}}` redirects, actual value\n`{{total_redirects}}` redirect(s).\n","failure":"Number of customer redirects were exceeeded. {{total_redirects}} found\n{{max_redirects}} expected.\n","remediation":"Reduce the number of redirects in the `.htaccess` file.\n","severity":2,"signature":"06969d9357c874bb4362be644efff408fea10d8c"}
